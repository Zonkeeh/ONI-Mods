Ever wanted to declutter/remove some products from a certain farm, or want an easier way to remove gas?

This mod adds 3 new trash buildings (Gas,Liquid,Solid) that will remove their storage contents, with configurable options.

[h1]Specifics[/h1]
[list]
    [*] Adds 3 new buildings to the game, each next to their respective element storage method in the building menu.
    [*] These trashcan buildings can remove stored contents with either a click of a button or automatically after a set time period (when enabled).
    [*] The solids trashcan also acts as a storage container, meaning duplicants can remove/store items within it.
    [*] Trashcan's power usage (or lack there of) as well as their capacity and building options can be customised in the config file.
    [*] Trashcan's are also enabled/disabled by the automation grid. When disabled they will not empty and their internal timer will stop.
    [*] Trashcan's will also show their [b]Capacity[/b] and [b]Auto-Trash[/b] status on their status cards.

[h1]Future Updates[/h1]
In future some ideas for expansion would be enabling another resource to be dropped upon 'compaction' of the trash, such that mass is not just removed. Would love to hear your views on this!
