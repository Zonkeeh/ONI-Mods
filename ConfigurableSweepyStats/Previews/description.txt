[h1][b]Configurable Sweepy Stats[/b][/h1]
[b]Change sweep bot storage, battery, speed and radius![/b]


[h1]Description[/h1]
Wanted to make a sweep bot store double it's amount, or not depend on power to perform? Or would you just like more information available?

This mod adds the ability to customize how sweep bots perform, from their storage (and their station's) to their movement speed.

[h1]Specifics[/h1]
[list]
    [*] Can change sweep bot's individual move speed and probing radius.
    [*] Changes global sweep bot variables, such as: storage capacity, battery capacity, battery depletion rate, movement speed, probing radius.
    [*] Provides some new status card items to display a sweep bot's storage capacity (current/capacity), it's current battery percentage and a debug item to show various variables (speed, distance travelled, probing radius, battery delta).
    [*] Provides functionality to change the sweep bot station's storage capacity and adds a status card item to show it's current storage status.
    [*] Adds a side screen to adjust a station's sweep bot stats (speed and probing radius). As well as the ability to follow cam the sweep bot on a button press (useful for finding them).
    [*] Adds a range indicator to the sweep bot station to show how far a specific sweep bot can roam from it's base station.
    [*] Config file has more parameters to configure balancing, such as battery depletion based on movement speed and the station's building definitions.

[h3][b]Debug Mode[/b][/h3]
[b]DebugMode[/b] - Enables debug mode, when enabled will show the debug status item and print the config variables to output_log. [i](Default: false)[/i]

[h3][b]Sweep Bot Variables[/b][/h3]
[b]StorageCapacity[/b] - Float that defines the storage capacity of the sweep bot, default is 2x the vanilla value. [i](Default: 1000.0)[/i]
[b]SweepyUsesPower[/b] - Decides whether sweep bots should use power. [i](Default: true)[/i]
[b]BatteryDepletionRate[/b] - Float that defines the delta for battery depletion, default is the same as vanilla. [i](Default: 40.0)[/i]

[b]StationStorageCapacity[/b] - Float that defines the storage capacity of the base station, default 3x vanilla value. [i](Default: 3000.0)[/i]

                                                                                          [i][b]Disclaimer:[/b] In the case where invalid arguments are given the default values will be used.[/i]


[h1]Future Updates[/h1]
In future some ideas for expansion would be including buttons to make or remove a sweep bot from a station, so that they're not make on building creation.
