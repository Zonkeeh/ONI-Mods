[h1][b]Critter Proof Doors[/b][/h1]
[b]Doors that completely block critter movement, even when open! [/b]

[h1]Description[/h1]
Have you ever wanted to just say no to critters who kindly want to escape your enclosure? Especially whilst keeping the door open/auto/unlocked for your duplicants?

This mod aims to provide a balanced, practical and configurable solution that forces critters to stay in their place.
