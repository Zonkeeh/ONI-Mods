[h1]Specifics[/h1]
[list]
    [*] Doors are unlocked through the refined objects node in the tech tree.
    [*] They appear in the base menu alongside their default counterparts and cost refined metal.
    [*] Futuristic Door - This door is the internal POI door and acts like a vanilla pneumatic door, meaning gases and liquids can pass through it.
[*] Facility Door - This door is the facility double door, meaning it is 2x3 tiles big. It therefore costs double the requirements as a normal door (and a little plastic). It acts the same as a manual airlock.

[*] Security Door - This door is the POI base external door, however it does not come with bioscan capability. It acts the same as a mechanized airlock meaning it requires power. As a perk of its cost it is also a little faster than it's counterparts.
