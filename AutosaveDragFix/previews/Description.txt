[h1][b]Autosave Drag Fix[/b][/h1]
[b]Provides various options to stop the carnage whilst dragging a tool on autosave! [/b]

[h1]Description[/h1]
Had the issue where you drag a million cables, pipes or cancelled all your scheduled builds?

This is a simple mod that automatically stops a drag on autosave, kindly leaving your pre-autosave dragged queue where it is without causing a rift in your colony! If configured it will also send you a warning notification & reset your tool to default.
