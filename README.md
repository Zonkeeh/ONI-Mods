## About
This repo of Oxygen Not Included mods is developed by Zonkeeh and is worked on for fun, interest, learning and as a side project. Coding is a great passion of mine and this is therefore why is repo is public. If you feel like you want to learn to build mods or just experiment then feel free to use my mods as an example, however, if you do so please kindly use me as reference. As mentioned above this is a fun side-project and so we ask that you treat it as such. No negative comments/attitude please, if you have a problem with something/want to discuss something feel free to report an issue.

**Happy modding and gaming all!**

## Want to update, develop or expand my Mods? (Updates & Development)

## Mod Ideas/Requests
We're happy to take new mod ideas, be that big or small. These mod ideas can be posted on the issues section under the [Mod Request Template](https://github.com/Zonkeeh/ONI-Mods/issues/new?assignees=&labels=mod+request&template=mod-request--idea-.md&title=%5BMod+Request%5D). Obviously these mods are subject to user opinion and so you will be contacted if we take up the idea. Note these mods will be design and made by us and so we hold all rights, as well as this we ask for you to be able to test the mod alongside development if possible.


## Mod Updates/ New Features
We are also happy to add new features to mods if we see them to be of great value, or, in some cases, good QoL fixes. These are specific for already made mods and we ask that you post a request under an issue template named [Feature Request](https://github.com/Zonkeeh/ONI-Mods/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature-request--update-request-.md&title=%5BNew+Feature%5D).

## Issue Reporting (Bugs/Errors)
As with all coding solutions it is often impossible to test all outcomes/solutions and so some errors slip through the cracks. As moding is a side project for us we ask you respectfully fill out an issue in the issues section under a [Bug Template](https://github.com/Zonkeeh/ONI-Mods/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D). We can then assess the bug, it's status and impact and deal with it or mark it relevantly. Again, we will only respond to respectful posts.
