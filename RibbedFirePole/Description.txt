[h1][b] Ribbed Fire Pole [/b][/h1]
[b] Mid to Late game firepole alternative. Now with config! [/b]

[h1]Description[/h1]
End game bases require lots of moving and shaking to get to places. Have you ever wanted to reduce the amount of ladders/fire poles? Well this is what this mod aims to do! A mid-to-late game climbing option that pairs the upward speed of a ladder and the downward speed of a fire pole.
