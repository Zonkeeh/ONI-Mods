[h1][b]Oxygen Not Needed[/b][/h1]
[b]Duplicants no longer require Oxygen![/b]


[h1]Description[/h1]
Ever wanted to test out some function without duplicants moaning about oxygen and that stupid thing called breathing?

This mod enables a world setting option to stop duplicants from needing/consuming oxygen. This option can also be forced to all existing saves.


[h2]Mod Version: [b]1.0.1[/b][/h2]
[h2]Latest Tested Game Version:[b] CS-444111[/b][/h2]


[h1]Specifics[/h1]
[list]
    [*] Removes oxygen consumption from the duplicants.
    [*] Removes duplican'ts ability to drown when submerged in a liquid.
    [*] Removes the need to fill AtmoSuits and JetPacks with oxygen as they will always be full.
    [*] Option can be found in game settings on new meteor creation.
    [*] Duplicants will also not have their ears popped by overpressure.
