[h1][b]Duplicant Lifecycles[/b][/h1]
[b]Duplicant life stages with side effects, benefits and even death! [/b]

[h1]Description[/h1]
Have you ever wondered why duplicants can live forever? Or maybe you just want to add an extra bit of spice and challenge to the game?

This mod provides a twist by giving duplicants a life cycle where they grow up, age and even die when too old. All with customisable features.

[h1]Specifics[/h1]
[list]
    [*] Duplicants will now have a Limited Lifespan trait (both new and existing duplicants).
    [*] Duplicants who are older than the max age threshold will die, this mean if you load a save with old duplicants you will be in shock.
    [*] Fully customisable attribute multipliers/modifiers and age boundaries.
    [*] Includes a new trait accessible by the Vacilitator called [b][i]Immortal[/i][/b], duplicants with this trait will receive a slight stat buff (configurable) and will not be effected by the aging limits.

[h1]Options[/h1]
Configuration of this mod and a basic template can be found in the following locations:
[list]
[*][b]Windows[/b] •  ~\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods\Steam\1876444268\Config.json
[*][b]Mac[/b] •  ~/Library/Application Support/unity.Klei.Oxygen Not Included/mods/Steam/1876444268\Config.json
[/list]

[b]Maximum Age[/b] - Duplicants will die off at a maximum age, this must be a floating point number greater than 0 and obviously must be larger than the age boundaries. (Default: 200 Cycles)

[b]Age Cutoffs[/b] - These cutoffs are used for each [i]growth stage[/i] of a duplicant: Youth, Middle Aged & Elderly. Once these cutoffs have been reached the duplicant will enter the dying state where they have heavily reduced stats and have a chance to die every cycle up to the max age. (Default: 30/140/180 Cycles)

[b]Use Percentage of Total Stats[/b] - This option decides whether to use a percentage of a duplicants attribute to multiply against (true) OR to use the defined base value as the base for the calculation. (Default: true)

[b]Custom Stat Base Value[/b] - Acts as a base for the multipliers, for instance this can be set to 0 to ensure no attributes are being changed. Only used if the above statement is false. (Default: 4)

[b]Enable Features[/b] - These two options can be used to enable/disable both the death feature and immortal trait. (Default: true, true)

[b]Time To Die Probability Increase[/b] - Acts as an increase in randomness to lower the chance a duplicant dies on a given cycle when in the dying stage. This simply decreases the offs by x. This is mainly useful when the cutoffs are low.  (Default: 0)

[b]Attribute Multipliers[/b] - Multipliers are used to change attributes in each [i]growth stage[/i]: Youth, Middle Aged, Elderly, Dying & the unique trait Immortal. These effect the stats by multiplying (go figure) with either the duplicant's total for a stat or the base value. Can be both negative or positive but have a limit at +/-10. Example a multiplier of 1 will increase a duplicant's attribute by either 100% of its total or 100% of it's custom base. (Default: 1.0/0.35/-0.35/-1.0/0.1)

                                                                                          [i][b]Disclaimer:[/b] In the case where invalid arguments are given the default values will be used.[/i]
